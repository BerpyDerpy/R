# Regression Projects in R

This repository contains a guide to performing classic regression tasks in R, using Google Colab, working with two built‑in datasets—**mtcars** and **iris**—to explore, model, and predict.


##  Getting Started

### 🛠️ Packages Used

* **ggplot2**: For creating high‑quality, layered graphics.
* **dplyr**: For data manipulation and transformation.

###  Workflow Overview

1. **Load data**: Use built‑in datasets `mtcars` and `iris`.
2. **Explore data**: View the first few rows with `head()`, calculate summary statistics, and visualize relationships with scatter plots.
3. **Fit regression models**: Use `lm(formula, data = ...)` to build linear models.
4. **Interpret results**: Call `summary()` on your model to see coefficients, p‑values, and R².
5. **Make predictions**: Use `predict(model, newdata)` to estimate outcomes on custom inputs.
